<h2><center>Event Management</center></h2>
<div id="newspaper">
An event, in a computing context, is any identifiable occurrence that has
significance for system hardware or software. User-generated events include keystrokes and
mouse clicks, among a wide variety of other possibilities. System-generated events include
program loading and errors, also among a wide variety of other possibilities. An event
typically represents some message, token, count, pattern, value, or marker that can be
recognized within an ongoing stream of monitored inputs, such as network traffic, specific
error conditions or signals, thresholds crossed, counts accumulated, and so on.
            A wedding planner is a professional who assists with the design, planning and
management of a client&#39;s wedding. Weddings are significant events in people&#39;s lives and as
such, couples are often willing to spend considerable amount of money to ensure that their
weddings are well-organized. Wedding planners are often used by couples who work long
hours and have little spare time available for sourcing and managing wedding venues and
wedding suppliers.
            Professional wedding planners are based worldwide but the industry is the largest in
the USA, India, western Europe and China. Various wedding planning courses are available
to those who wish to pursue the career. Planners generally charge either a percentage of the
total wedding cost, or a flat fee.
            Planners are also popular with couples planning a destination wedding, where the
documentation and paperwork can be complicated. Any country where a wedding is held
requires different procedures depending on the nationality of each the bride and the groom.
For instance, US citizens marrying in Italy require a Nulla Osta (affidavit sworn in front of the
US consulate in Italy), plus an Atto Notorio (sworn in front of the Italian consulate in the US
or at a court in Italy), and legalization of the above. Some countries instead have
agreements and the couple can get their No Impediment forms from their local registrar and
have it translated by the consulate in the country of the wedding. A local wedding planner
can take care of the different procedures.
            A corporate event can be defined as a gathering that is sponsored by a business for
its employees, business partners, clients and/or prospective clients. These events can be for

larger audiences such as conventions or smaller events like conferences, meetings or
holiday parties.
            Corporate entertainment describes private events held by corporations or businesses
for their staff, clients or stakeholders. These events can be for large audiences such as
conventions and conferences, or smaller events such as retreats, holiday parties or even
private concerts.It is also commonly used to mean corporate hospitality, the process of
entertaining guests at corporate events. The companies that provides corporate
entertainment are called corporate event planners or corporate booking agencies.
