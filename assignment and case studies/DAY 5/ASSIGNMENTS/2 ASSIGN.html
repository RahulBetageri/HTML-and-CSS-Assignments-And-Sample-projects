they also are those you will want by your side when you walk down the aisle and say
your vows. Typically your wedding party is made up of your sisters, brothers and
closest friends or family members.This page will serve as a guide to share all of the
duties, roles and responsibilities that are involved for each participant of the wedding
party. Each individual member of the wedding party has unique responsibilities, so

    An engagement party is a party held to celebrate a couple&#39;s recent engagement
and to help future wedding guests to get to know one another. Traditionally, the
bride&#39;s parents host the engagement party, but many modern couples host their own
celebration.
